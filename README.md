<h3>Summarize PDF Contents</h3>
<p>As demonstrated in the Automate Bard post, a user can upload a a PDF and prompt Bard to generate a summary. While current limitations restrict it to analyzing one PDF file at a time, this provides a workaround for summarization when Bard cannot open PDF files directly. With continued improvements, the goal is for Bard to be able to intake multiple PDF files documents and produce concise, contextual summaries. This could help users filter large amounts of textual information more efficiently, whether for research, study, or professional tasks. Relying on Bard for summaries also allows humans to dedicate more mental energy to analysis.</p>
